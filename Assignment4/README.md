# Assignment 3 Convolutional Neural Network

## Introduction

Build convolutional neural network to predict the pulmonary disease of patient from theie chest X-ray images.

Also, build CNN using Tensorflow.

## Data

600 samples of Ches X-rays images for training with 300 normal and 300 abnormal.

60 samples for testing.
