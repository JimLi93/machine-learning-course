# Assignment 5 Brain Signal Classification

## Introduction

Build CNN-based and RNN-based models to predict motor imagery class based on EEG signal.

Use Tensorflow to build LSTM model and EEGNet model.

## Data

Use EEG data, 604 samples for training and 152 samples for validation.

Each sample data contains 22 channels*200 time points.

EEG is a method to record an electrogram of the spontaneous electrical activity of the brain.

There are six classes of motor imagery class in the EEG data.
